# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Context <a name="overview-context"></a>

As Airbnb has grown in popularity, many cities have introduced regulations to limit the number of properties listed. Paris, one of Airbnbâ€™s most active markets, saw significant regulatory changes in **2015**, aimed at curbing short-term rentals. This analysis seeks to explore **pricing trends**, **market dynamics**, and **the impact of these regulations on new host registrations**.

To achieve this, I analyzed **Airbnb listing data for Paris**, focusing on:

- **Price trends across neighborhoods**
- **Price differences based on accommodation capacity**
- **The number of new hosts over time**
- **The effect of 2015 regulations on host activity and pricing**

### Actions <a name="overview-actions"></a>

To conduct this analysis, the following steps were taken:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**:
   - Ensuring price formats were correct.
   - Handling missing or inconsistent values.
   - Converting host registration dates into a suitable time-series format.

2. **Data Aggregation**:
   - **Grouping listings by neighborhood** to analyze **average price** trends.
   - **Filtering listings in Elysee**, the most expensive neighborhood, to assess **price variation by accommodation capacity**.
   - **Creating a time-series dataset** to track **new hosts entering the market** and **price fluctuations over time**.

3. **Visualization & Analysis**:
   - **Horizontal Bar Chart:** Average Price by **Neighborhood**.
   - **Horizontal Bar Chart:** Average Price by **Accommodates in Elysee**.
   - **Line Chart:** **New Hosts Over Time**, with **vertical shading** highlighting the **2015 regulation period**.
   - **Line Chart:** **Average Price Over Time**, with **horizontal shading** highlighting **max price fluctuations**.

### Results & Discussion <a name="overview-results"></a>

- **New host registrations dropped significantly after 2015**, indicating a strong impact of regulations.
- **Despite regulations, average prices have continued to increase**, possibly due to market adjustments and compliance costs.
- **Elysee remains the most expensive neighborhood**, with higher-priced listings persisting even after the regulations.
- **Market contraction post-2015 has led to a more competitive environment for hosts**, benefiting those who remained in the market.

# Data Overview & Preparation <a name="data-overview"></a>

To conduct this analysis, I used an **Airbnb dataset** containing listing details, prices, host registration dates, and accommodation capacities. The key steps involved:

- Cleaning price data to ensure numerical consistency.
- Converting `host_since` to a datetime format for time-series analysis.
- Aggregating data by **neighborhood** and **accommodation size** to explore pricing trends.
- Resampling new host data **annually** to visualize market trends over time.

# Pricing Trends in Paris <a name="pricing-trends"></a>

### Average Price by Neighborhood

A horizontal bar chart was created to compare **average prices across different neighborhoods**, sorted from most expensive to least expensive. **Elysee** emerged as the costliest neighborhood.

### Average Price by Accommodates in Elysee

A second horizontal bar chart was created to explore how **price changes based on the number of accommodates** in **Elysee**, providing insights into pricing structures in high-end areas.

___

# Impact of 2015 Regulations <a name="regulation-impact"></a>

### New Hosts Over Time

A **line chart** was used to track **new hosts entering the Paris market** each year. A **vertical shaded region** was added to mark the **2015 regulatory change**, illustrating the immediate decline in new host registrations.

### Average Price Over Time

A **second line chart** was created to analyze **price trends over time**. A **horizontal shaded region** was included to highlight the **peak pricing range**, showing how prices have evolved post-regulation.

___

# Key Insights <a name="key-insights"></a>

1. **Regulations Introduced in 2015 Significantly Reduced New Host Registrations**
   - Before 2015, the number of new hosts increased steadily.
   - After 2015, there was a **sharp decline**, indicating the effectiveness of market restrictions.

2. **Despite Regulations, Prices Have Increased Over Time**
   - This suggests **high demand, increased compliance costs, or limited supply** as possible factors driving prices higher.

3. **Elysee Continues to be the Most Expensive Neighborhood**
   - Despite regulations, Elysee remains a high-priced market.
   - This indicates that **regulations have not necessarily led to price reductions in prime locations**.

4. **Fewer Listings, More Competition**
   - The drop in new hosts means existing hosts **face less competition**, possibly allowing them to **charge higher prices**.

___

# Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

- **The 2015 Airbnb regulations had a strong impact on market entry**, reducing new host participation.
- **Pricing trends indicate that Airbnb remains lucrative in Paris**, especially in high-demand neighborhoods.
- **Further research could explore guest booking behaviors** to understand whether **regulations have impacted consumer demand or only host supply**.

The results of this analysis can be useful for **policymakers**, **Airbnb hosts**, and **investors**, helping them better understand how regulations shape market dynamics in short-term rentals.
