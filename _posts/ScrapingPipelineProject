# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Context <a name="overview-context"></a>

I've been wanting to find a way to build my own database so that I can get soccer match data to make predictions on, visualize, and extend analysis into the world of sports betting. I found a course done by `Mckay Johns that taught me the basics of webscraping. 
The goal is to create pipeline for match event data (this specific post) and then do the same for historical data. 

<br>
<br>
### Actions <a name="overview-actions"></a>

For this project, I used beautiful soup for scraping along with selenium, pandas and numpy for transformations and string manipulation, json for dealing with html data and converting them to dictionaries, pydantic for creating data models, time for responsible scraping, supbabase where I'll host the data and typing for bringing in lists. 


The goal is to create 4 tables: match_events, players, teams, and match. They'll be linked through id's that map each to one another.

# Concept Overview  <a name="concept-overview"></a>

<br>
#### Web Scraping

Web scraping at a high levels involves extracting data from websites using packages like BeautifulSoup and requests. It allows us to automate data collection from web pages by parsing the HTML and extracting the required information. 


<br>
#### Data Modeling

Data modeling is to structure and organize data in a way that makes it easily manageable, understandable, and usable. It is cruial for this task because we need to be able to find information about players outside of a certain match, teams outside of a certain match, or look up a specific match to get that information. 
By creating a data model with Pydantic we can store our data in an efficient in and meaningful manner for easier analysis and data retrieval going forward. 


<br>
#### Using functions to automate a pipeline

The use of functions to automate this pipeline will be useful because it will allow me to parse a page, clean the data, and extract information for different variants of that page. In this case, getting different matches associated to a team based on url's for that team.

# Data Overview & Preparation  <a name="data-overview"></a>

First, I'll import all of the packages mentioned:

``` python

# Import Packages Needed
import json
import time

# Import statistical packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Import Scraper
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from selenium import webdriver

# Prepare data for insertion
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
from supabase import create_client, Client

```

<br>

* Load in the Python libraries we require for scraping data, transforming it, and pushing to a cloud PostgreSQL database.

Next, I need to initiate the driver. 

``` python
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
```

From there I'll pass in our 
<br>
A sample of this data (the first 10 rows) can be seen below:
<br>
<br>

| **customer_id** | **campaign_name** | **mailer_type** | **signup_flag** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 74 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 1 |
| 524 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 1 |
| 607 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 1 |
| 343 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 0 |
| 322 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 1 |
| 115 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 0 |
| 1 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 1 |
| 120 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 1 |
| 52 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 1 |
| 405 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 0 |
| 435 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 0 |

<br>
In the DataFrame we have:

* customer_id
* campaign name
* mailer_type (either Mailer1 or Mailer2)
* signup_flag (either 1 or 0)

# Applying Chi-Square Test For Independence <a name="chi-square-application"></a>

<br>
#### State Hypotheses & Acceptance Criteria For Test

The very first thing we need to do in any form of Hypothesis Test is state our Null Hypothesis, our Alternate Hypothesis, and the Acceptance Criteria (more details on these in the section above)

In the code below we code these in explcitly & clearly so we can utilise them later to explain the results.  We specify the common Acceptance Criteria value of 0.05.

```python

# specify hypotheses & acceptance criteria for test
null_hypothesis = "There is no relationship between mailer type and signup rate.  They are independent"
alternate_hypothesis = "There is a relationship between mailer type and signup rate.  They are not independent"
acceptance_criteria = 0.05

```

<br>
#### Calculate Observed Frequencies & Expected Frequencies

As mentioned in the section above, in a Chi-Square Test For Independence, the *observed frequencies* are the true values that weâ€™ve seen, in other words the actual rates per group in the data itself.  The *expected frequencies* are what we would *expect* to see based on *all* of the data combined.

The below code:

* Summarises our dataset to a 2x2 matrix for *signup_flag* by *mailer_type*
* Based on this, calculates the:
    * Chi-Square Statistic
    * p-value
    * Degrees of Freedom
    * Expected Values
* Prints out the Chi-Square Statistic & p-value from the test
* Calculates the Critical Value based upon our Acceptance Criteria & the Degrees Of Freedom
* Prints out the Critical Value

```python

# aggregate our data to get observed values
observed_values = pd.crosstab(campaign_data["mailer_type"], campaign_data["signup_flag"]).values

# run the chi-square test
chi2_statistic, p_value, dof, expected_values = chi2_contingency(observed_values, correction = False)

# print chi-square statistic
print(chi2_statistic)
>> 1.94

# print p-value
print(p_value)
>> 0.16

# find the critical value for our test
critical_value = chi2.ppf(1 - acceptance_criteria, dof)

# print critical value
print(critical_value)
>> 3.84

```
<br>
Based upon our observed values, we can give this all some context with the sign-up rate of each group.  We get:

* Mailer 1 (Low Cost): **32.8%** signup rate
* Mailer 2 (High Cost): **37.8%** signup rate

From this, we can see that the higher cost mailer does lead to a higher signup rate.  The results from our Chi-Square Test will provide us more information about how confident we can be that this difference is robust, or if it might have occured by chance.

We have a Chi-Square Statistic of **1.94** and a p-value of **0.16**.  The critical value for our specified Acceptance Criteria of 0.05 is **3.84**

**Note** When applying the Chi-Square Test above, we use the parameter *correction = False* which means we are applying what is known as the *Yate's Correction* which is applied when your Degrees of Freedom is equal to one.  This correction helps to prevent overestimation of statistical signficance in this case.

# Analysing The Results <a name="chi-square-results"></a>

At this point we have everything we need to understand the results of our Chi-Square test - and just from the results above we can see that, since our resulting p-value of **0.16** is *greater* than our Acceptance Criteria of 0.05 then we will _retain_ the Null Hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant difference between the signup rates of Mailer 1 and Mailer 2.

We can make the same conclusion based upon our resulting Chi-Square statistic of **1.94** being _lower_ than our Critical Value of **3.84**

To make this script more dynamic, we can create code to automatically interpret the results and explain the outcome to us...

```python

# print the results (based upon p-value)
if p_value <= acceptance_criteria:
    print(f"As our p-value of {p_value} is lower than our acceptance_criteria of {acceptance_criteria} - we reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that: {alternate_hypothesis}")
else:
    print(f"As our p-value of {p_value} is higher than our acceptance_criteria of {acceptance_criteria} - we retain the null hypothesis, and conclude that: {null_hypothesis}")

>> As our p-value of 0.16351 is higher than our acceptance_criteria of 0.05 - we retain the null hypothesis, and conclude that: There is no relationship between mailer type and signup rate.  They are independent


# print the results (based upon p-value)
if chi2_statistic >= critical_value:
    print(f"As our chi-square statistic of {chi2_statistic} is higher than our critical value of {critical_value} - we reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that: {alternate_hypothesis}")
else:
    print(f"As our chi-square statistic of {chi2_statistic} is lower than our critical value of {critical_value} - we retain the null hypothesis, and conclude that: {null_hypothesis}")
    
>> As our chi-square statistic of 1.9414 is lower than our critical value of 3.841458820694124 - we retain the null hypothesis, and conclude that: There is no relationship between mailer type and signup rate.  They are independent

```
<br>
As we can see from the outputs of these print statements, we do indeed retain the null hypothesis.  We could not find enough evidence that the signup rates for Mailer 1 and Mailer 2 were different - and thus conclude that there was no significant difference.

# Discussion <a name="discussion"></a>

While we saw that the higher cost Mailer 2 had a higher signup rate (37.8%) than the lower cost Mailer 1 (32.8%) it appears that this difference is not significant, at least at our Acceptance Criteria of 0.05.

Without running this Hypothesis Test, the client may have concluded that they should always look to go with higher cost mailers - and from what we've seen in this test, that may not be a great decision.  It would result in them spending more, but not *necessarily* gaining any extra revenue as a result

Our results here also do not say that there *definitely isn't a difference between the two mailers* - we are only advising that we should not make any rigid conclusions *at this point*.  

Running more A/B Tests like this, gathering more data, and then re-running this test may provide us, and the client more insight!
