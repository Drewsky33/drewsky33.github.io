I've just been hired by Maven Supplies to design and build an executive-level BI solution.

### Situation: 

**Create a dashboard to track key KPI's (sales, profit, returns), compare performance in our markets, analyze the profitability of categories, and help our client id high-value customers.**

**This will require:**

* High level KPI cards for general monitory. 
* Filterability by Date, Segment, Category, State, Region, and City. 
* Have a breakdown for Sales relative to our goals by Region. 
* Have a map, that can track Sales & Profit by City. 
* Create, a treemap to look at Sales in our categories and their subcategories.
* Have a trended view of Sales & Profit by Month.
* Finally, we'd like drill actions that follow a standard reading pattern. Left to right and down.

### Task:
I need to develop a Tableau dashboard to visualize earthquake data comprehensively so that my stakeholders will be able to quickly identify meaningful insights or trends related to this 30 day sample.

---
### Action:

1. **Track Largest Earthquakes:** Create a table to view the 10 largest earthquakes on a specific date or all-time for this 30-day sample.
2. **Geographical Distribution:** Create world map to see the frequency of earthquake for a region as well as their magnitude.
3. **Broad Location Percentage:** Observe the percentage of earthquakes categorized broadly - North America, South America, Central America, Asia, Oceania, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
4. **Country-wise Frequency:** Analyze the frequency of earthquakes within for the countries within each of the broad locations above, providing insights into regions prone to seismic activity.

#### Magnitude Analysis
4. **Average Magnitude:** Understand the average magnitude of earthquakes for different countries on a given day or all all time. 
5. **Maximum Magnitude:** Identify the maximum magnitudes recorded for different countries on a given day or all time.

---
### Result
The created dashboard allows users to:
1. Identify quick insights into earthquakes for a 30 day sample on a given day or for the duration of that 30 days.
2. Have a quick look at seismic activity across the globe by zoning in on areas with high frequency and differentiate by magnitude with efficient use of color.
3. Have access to a country level analysis for frequency, average magnitude, or maximum magnitude.

### Example Analysis:

##### What are the most earthquake-prone regions during this time period and on July 25th, 2022. 
* All time: North America has the highest percentage of Earthquakes in this dataset at 53% followed by Central America at 20%. 
* July 25th, 2022: North America's share of global earthquakes increased to 55%. On this day, Central America and Asia are very close with shares of 12% and 11% respectively. 

--- 

### If given more time I would:
* Explore magnitude trends over time. At what point in this sample were magnitudes at their peak. This could help alert safety authorities to have high awareness during a certain period of the year.
